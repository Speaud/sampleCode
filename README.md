# Bash scraps

When I am using a Windows OS I use [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) which uses a MINGW64 dialect.

Best Resource - http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html

There isn't a compile or build process for all of this so there isn't much to the directory structure. This is essentially a place for me to keep "bash scraps" and what-have-you.

Not following branching methods. This is a dump site.
