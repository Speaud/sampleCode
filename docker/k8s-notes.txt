Kubernetes (aka "k8s")
    - for containerized apps
    - cluster orchestration system
    - deploy containerized applications to a cluster then let k8s handle scaling/load/etc.

Minikube
    - lightweight k8s distro


Cluster
    - consists of Nodes
    - controlled by Master (aka "MainThread")
        - Rule: if a Cluster handles production traffic it should contain a min of 3 child Nodes

    Master
        - manages the Cluster
        - exposes Kubernetes API

    Node(s)
        - VM, worker machine of Cluster
        - Kubelet (IPC-esque)
        - contains tools for handling container operations (i.e., Docker)
        - nodes communicate with the master using the Kubernetes API
